# Go Remote Debugging Example

The goal of this project is to clarify how to configure a Go web application
for remote debugging in a Docker / Kubernetes environment. The web application
is based on [https://github.com/lukehoban/webapp-go/tree/debugging](https://github.com/lukehoban/webapp-go/tree/debugging).

See the [Helm Chart](helm/webapp-go/README.md) for installation instructions.
